## 📌 Why Learn DSA?

Before diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), it’s crucial to understand **why** you’re doing it. DSA isn’t just an academic requirement — it’s a foundational skill for any software engineer or developer.

### ✨ Benefits:
- 💼 **Interviews**: Companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and startups focus heavily on DSA during technical interviews.
- 🧠 **Problem Solving**: DSA improves your logic, reasoning, and critical thinking.
- ⚙️ **Performance**: A strong grasp of DSA helps you build faster, more efficient programs.
- 🧪 **Real-World Coding**: Everything from search engines to social media algorithms relies on efficient data structures.

## 🗺️ 6-Week DSA Master Plan

Each week builds on the previous one, covering both **theory and practical coding exercises**. Aim for **2.5–3 hours daily**, and regularly revisit difficult problems.

### Week 1: DSA Foundation & Python Prerequisites

#### Goals
- Understand why DSA is essential.
- Review Python fundamentals.
- Learn Big-O and complexity basics.

#### Topics
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Functions, loops, recursion
- Time and space complexity (Big-O notation)

#### Action Plan
- Read **Chapters 1–2** from the book.
- Solve 5 Python warm-up problems on HackerRank.
- Watch NeetCode’s “Big-O Notation Explained”.

---

### Week 2: Basic Data Structures

#### Goals
- Learn and implement foundational data structures.

#### Topics
- Arrays & Strings
- Stacks & Queues
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

#### Action Plan
- Book: **Chapters 3–5**
- Implement each structure from scratch.
- Solve problems:
  - Two Sum
  - Valid Parentheses
  - Reverse Linked List
  - Merge Two Lists

#### Tips
- Focus on **how** data is added, removed, and accessed.
- Try solving problems **without looking at solutions** initially.

---

### Week 3: Hashing, Recursion & Backtracking

#### Goals
- Learn hashing for fast lookup.
- Master recursion and its stack behavior.
- Begin solving backtracking problems.

#### Topics
- Hash maps and sets
- Recursive functions and patterns
- Backtracking (exhaustive search)

#### Action Plan
- Book: **Chapter 6**
- Solve:
  - Group Anagrams
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Word Search
  - Sudoku Solver

---

### Week 4: Advanced Data Structures

#### Goals
- Work with complex structures used in real systems.

#### Topics
- Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Heaps (Min/Max)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Tries (Prefix Trees)

#### Action Plan
- Book: **Chapters 7–10**
- Implement:
  - Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
  - MinHeap/MaxHeap from scratch
  - Graph using adjacency list and matrix
  - Trie insert and search

#### Practice
- Diameter of Binary Tree
- Kth Largest Element in a Stream
- Clone Graph
- Longest Word in Dictionary (Trie)

---

### Week 5: Mastering Problem-Solving Patterns

#### Goals
- Recognize common coding patterns to solve problems efficiently.

#### Patterns
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Greedy
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (Intro)

#### Action Plan
- Study 1–2 patterns per day.
- Solve key problems:
  - Container With Most Water (Two Pointers)
  - Longest Substring Without Repeat (Sliding Window)
  - Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Binary Search)
  - Jump Game (Greedy)
  - Climbing Stairs (Dynamic Programming)

#### Tips
- Build a **personal cheat sheet** for each pattern.
- Always understand **why** the pattern works.

---

### Week 6: Projects + Interview Prep

#### Goals
- Apply knowledge in real-world scenarios.
- Begin mock interview practice.

#### Mini Projects
- ✅ Spell Checker → Trie + Hashing
- ✅ Pathfinding Visualizer → Graph (BFS/DFS)
- ✅ Event Scheduler → MinHeap for event tracking

#### Interview Focus
- Solve the **Blind 75** problems on LeetCode.
- Revisit tough problems from previous weeks.
- Join mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io).
