## About

This repo contains a detailed, structured 6-week roadmap for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. Designed for beginners to intermediates, it combines book study, coding practice, projects, and interview preparation.

---

## Why Learn DSA?

- **Ace technical interviews** at top companies.
- **Boost problem-solving skills** and logical thinking.
- Write **efficient and scalable code**.
- Build a strong foundation for software engineering.

## 6-Week Roadmap Overview

### Week 1: Foundation & Python Basics

- Why DSA matters
- Python syntax review (lists, dicts, loops, recursion)
- Big-O notation and time complexity
- Practice basic Python problems

### Week 2: Basic Data Structures

- Arrays, strings, stacks, queues
- Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Implement from scratch + solve common problems

### Week 3: Hashing, Recursion & Backtracking

- Hash maps and sets
- Deep dive into recursion
- Backtracking basics with example problems

### Week 4: Advanced Data Structures

- Trees (BST, traversals)
- Heaps (min/max)
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- Tries (prefix trees)

### Week 5: Problem-Solving Patterns

- Sliding window, two pointers
- Binary search, greedy algorithms
- Backtracking and dynamic programming intro

### Week 6: Projects & Interview Prep

- Mini projects applying learned concepts
- Practice the Blind 75 problems
- Mock interviews and revision

## Core Problem-Solving Patterns

| Pattern          | Example Problems                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Sliding Window   | Longest Substring Without Repeating   |
| Two Pointers     | Container With Most Water              |
| Binary Search    | Search in Rotated Sorted Array         |
| Backtracking     | N-Queens, Sudoku                      |
| Greedy           | Jump Game, Gas Station                |
| Dynamic Programming | Fibonacci, 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence |

---

## Tracking Progress

- Use a **Notion** or **Google Sheet** to log daily problems and concepts.
- Maintain a **coding notebook** for patterns and tricky problem notes.
- Revisit and **resubmit solutions weekly** to reinforce learning.
- Join coding communities or study groups for accountability.
